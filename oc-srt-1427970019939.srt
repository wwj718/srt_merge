1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,400
Yeah? All right.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,840
All right, good afternoon.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,000
And working to the last class of  how to  start a startup.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,380
So this is a little bit different than every other class.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,140
Every other class has been things that you should be thinking about

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,210
in general at the beginning of a Startup.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,270
And today, we're going to talk about things

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,600
that you don't have to think about for a while.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,890
In fact, you shouldn't.

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,320
But since, I'm not going to get to talk to most of you,

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,130
again before you get to sort of post-product market fit stage.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,190
I wanted to just give you the list of things

13
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,960
that you need to think about as your Startup scales,

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,510
and the list of the things that usually.

15
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,220
Founder failed to make the transition on.

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,200
So these are the topics we're going to talk about but again

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,180
all of these things are things that are not writing code

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,320
or talking to users.

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,490
Which means, with a few exceptions that I'll try to note,

20
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,940
you can ignore them until after you have product market fit.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,950
Most of these things, for most companies,

22
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,400
become important between months 12 and 24.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,000
But it's really more about stage than anything else.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,400
These are things that usually hit around 25 people

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,820
and definitely post product-market fit.

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,220
So just write these down somewhere

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,860
and look back at them when you get there.

28
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,490
So the first area we're going to talk about is Management.

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,200
At the beginning of a company there is no management,

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,770
and this actually works really well.

31
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,090
Before 20 or 25 employees most companies are structured

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,940
with everyone reporting to the founder, it's totally flat.

33
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,700
And that's really good, and that's what you want,

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,240
and at that stage that is the optimal way, for product,

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,270
that's the optimal structure for productivity.

36
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,960
But the thing that tricks people is that when,

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,740
when lack of structure fails, it fails all at once.

38
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,160
And so what works totally fine at 20 employees,

39
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,100
is from zero to 20 employees?

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,360
Is disastrous at 30.

41
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,900
And so you want to be aware that this transition will happen.

42
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,590
And you don't actually need to make the structure complicated.

43
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,540
In fact, you shouldn't.

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,070
All you need is for every employee to know, who their manager is?

45
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,310
And every, and there should be exactly one.

46
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,800
And, and every manager should know, who their direct reports are?

47
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,580
You want to ideally cluster people in teams that make sense of course.

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,890
But the most important thing

49
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,380
is that there's just clear reporting structure.

50
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,050
And that everyone knows, what it is.

51
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,520
And if you want to make changes to it

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,710
people understand how to make changes or to hire someone.

53
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,860
Clarity and simplicity are the most important things here.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
But failing to do it is really bad.

55
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,900
So, because it works in the early days to have no structure at all,

56
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,770
and, because it sort of feels cool to have no structure.

57
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,790
Many companies are like,

58
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,160
we're going to try this crazy new management theory

59
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,380
and have no structure.

60
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,980
What you want to do is innovate on your product

61
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,380
and your your business model?

62
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,370
Management structure is not,

63
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,490
where I would recommend trying to innovate.

64
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,570
So, don't make the mistake of having nothing

65
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,400
but don't make the other mistake of having something super complicated

66
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,090
A lot of people fall into this trap,

67
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,320
where they think it's like

68
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,730
you know, people feel cool if they're someones manager.

69
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,270
And if they're just an employee they don't feel cool.

70
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,780
So people come up with

71
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,100
these convoluted circular matrices management structures,

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,050
where you report to this person for this thing,

73
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,900
and this person for that thing, and this person for that thing.

74
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,490
But you know, actually this person reports to you for this thing.

75
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,410
That's a mistake too.

76
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,880
So don't, don't try to innovate here.

77
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,270
This is the first instance of an important shift,

78
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,000
in companies, or in, in, in the founders job.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,110
Before product market fit your only job that matters

80
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,990
is to build a great product, right,

81
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,750
you're number one job is to build a great product.

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,070
As the company grows and at about this,

83
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,350
you know, 25 or so employee size,

84
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,490
your main job shifts from building a great product.

85
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,920
To building a great company,

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,070
and it stays there for the rest of your time.

87
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,000
And this is probably the biggest shift in being a founder

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,220
that ever happens.

89
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,600
There are four failure cases we see all the time,

90
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,980
as founders become managers.

91
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,080
So I want to talk about the four most common ones.

92
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,880
The first one is being afraid to hire senior people.

93
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,320
In the early days of a Startup,

94
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,080
hiring senior people is usually a mistake.

95
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,850
You just want people that get stuff done.

96
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,100
and, and the willingness to work hard

97
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,590
and attitude matters more than experience.

98
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,210
As the company starts to scale, and about this time

99
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,560
when you have to put in place a basic management structure.

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,990
It is actually valuable to have senior people on the team.

101
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,200
You know, executives that have built companies before.

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,070
And almost all founders after the first time

103
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,530
they hire a really great executive

104
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,770
and that executive takes over big pieces of the business

105
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,000
and just makes them happen the founder says, wow,

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,420
I wish I had done that earlier.

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,540
But everybody makes this mistake and waits to long to do this,

108
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,230
so don't, don't be afraid to hire senior executives.

109
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,460
The second mistake is hero mode.

110
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,810
So, I will use the example of say that

111
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,350
someone that runs the customer service team.

112
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,920
Someone runs the customer service team,

113
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,780
they want to lead by example, this starts from a good place,

114
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,070
it's, it's the extreme of leading by example.

115
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,030
It's saying, you know what, I want my team to work really hard.

116
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,220
Rather than tell them to work hard I'm going to set an example

117
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,490
and I'm going to work 18 hours a day.

118
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,900
And I'm going to show people how to get a lot of tickets done.

119
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,880
But then the company starts growing.

120
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,180
Also they have the normal discomfort

121
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,410
of assigning a lot of work to other people.

122
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,690
So the company starts growing

123
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,820
and the ticket volume, keeps going up,

124
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,280
and now they have to do like 19 hours a day, and then 20 hours a day,

125
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,650
and it's just obviously, not working.

126
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,850
But they won't stop and hire people,

127
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,800
because they're like, if I stop, even for one day,

128
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,300
we're going to get behind on tickets.

129
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,660
The only way to get out of hero mode in this case

130
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,720
is to say, you know, what?

131
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,370
we're going to get behind on tickets for two or three weeks,

132
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,170
because I'm going to go off.

133
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,280
And I'm going to hire three more support team members

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,070
and I've calculated based off our growth rate that

135
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,260
this is going to last this long.

136
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,720
And next time, I'm not going to make the same mistake.

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,960
I'll get ahead of it and hire again.

138
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,730
But you actually have to make a tradeoff.

139
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,020
You actually, have to say, you know, what?

140
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,000
I need to hire more people

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,690
and we're going to get behind on other stuff.

142
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,350
That is the right answer.

143
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,930
The wrong answer is to stay in hero mode until you burnout,

144
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,240
which is what most people do.

145
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,700
Third mistake bad delegation.

146
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,770
Most founders have not managed people before

147
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,190
and they certainly haven't managed managers.

148
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,990
And so the way that the bad way you delegate is you say

149
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,370
hey, employee, we need to do this big thing.

150
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,050
You go off and research it.

151
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,550
Come back to me with all the data and the trade-offs,

152
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,960
I'll make a decision and tell it to you,

153
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,010
and then you'll go off and implement it.

154
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,680
That's how most founders delegate,

155
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,300
and that does not make people feel good

156
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,660
and it certainly doesn't scale.

157
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,210
A subtle difference but really important is to say,

158
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,650
hey, you're really smart, that's why I hired you.

159
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,150
You go off, here are the things to think about,

160
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,160
here's what I think, but you make this decision.

161
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,740
I totally trust you, and let me know what you decide.

162
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,270
That's the delegation that actually works.

163
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,700
because, I think,

164
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,450
because Steve Jobs was able to get away with the former

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,130
and make every decision himself,

166
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,340
and people just put up with it.

167
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,440
And every founder thinks they're the next Steve Jobs.

168
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,180
A lot of people try this. But I, for 99.9% of people.

169
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,200
The second method here works a lot better.

170
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,730
And then the fourth area is just a personal organization one.

171
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,590
When you are working on product,

172
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,850
you don't actually need to be that organized

173
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,290
in terms of how you run a company,

174
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,100
and how you talk to people about what they're working on.

175
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,010
But if you fail to get your own personal organization system right.

176
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,290
where you can keep track in some way of what you need to do,

177
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,310
and what everybody else is doing,

178
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,960
and what you need to follow up with them on.

179
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,110
That will come back to bite you,

180
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,500
so developing this early

181
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,440
as the company begins to scale is really important.

182
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,830
Two other things that we hear again and again from our founders,

183
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,260
they wished they had done earlier.

184
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,660
And that is simply writing down, how you do things?

185
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,440
And why you do things?

186
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,700
These two things, the how and the why, are really important.

187
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,610
I mean early there is you just tell everyone, employee,

188
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,550
when you're, like, sitting around,  having lunch or dinner, you know?

189
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,200
This is how we think about building products,

190
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,000
this is how we push production, you know,

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,790
this is how we handle customer support, whatever.

192
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,930
As you get bigger, you can't keep doing that.

193
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,830
And if you don't do it, someone else is just going to say it.

194
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,130
But if you write it down, and put it up on a Wiki or whatever,

195
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,330
that every employee reads.

196
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,300
You as the founder get to basically, write the law.

197
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,450
And, and if you write this down it will become law in the company.

198
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,220
And if you make everyone read this as the company hires 100

199
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,000
and then 1,000 employees people will read this and say, all right,

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,910
that's how we do things.

201
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,500
If you don't do it it will be like random oral tradition of

202
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,890
whatever the hiring manager or their best friend that they make

203
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,630
at their first week in the company tells them.

204
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,140
So writing down how you do things? And the why?

205
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,590
The why is the culture of values,

206
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,880
Brian Chesky talked about this really well.

207
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,320
Every founder I know wishes that they'd written down

208
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,130
both of these, the how and the why, earlier.

209
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,140
To just establish it as the company grows,

210
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,900
and then this becomes what happens.

211
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,730
I think it's one of the highest leverage things that you can do

212
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,560
that, that people don't.

213
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,570
All right. Next area, HR.

214
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,000
HR is another thing that most people correctly ignore

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,990
in the first phase of a Startup because again,

216
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,670
it's not writing code.

217
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,870
It's not talking to users.

218
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,430
But it's a huge mistake to continue to ignore it.

219
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,900
And the reason that I think most founders ignore it,

220
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,930
is they have in their mind this idea of,

221
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,890
like TV sitcom HR, you know, awfulness.

222
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,620
But it doesn't have to slow you down.

223
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,220
Actually, it speeds you up.

224
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,590
Most founders will say, out of one side of their mouth,

225
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,050
people are our most important asset.

226
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,210
And, the other side, we don't want any HR.

227
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,100
So, what they mean is, we don't want HR.

228
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,900
We don't want, like, the bad kind of TV HR.

229
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,310
What good HR means is, a few things.

230
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,030
A clearer structure, which Charlie talked about.

231
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,520
You know, a path for people about,

232
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,850
how they can evolve their careers?

233
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,970
Most important, one of the most important things

234
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,100
is Performance Feedback.

235
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,080
again, this happens organically early on,

236
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
people know how they're doing.

237
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,710
As the company gets to 25, 30, 45 people,

238
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,800
that gets lost and it doesn't have to be complex.

239
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,690
It can be super simple but there should be a way that it happens

240
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,640
and it should be frequent.

241
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,680
You know, people need to hear pretty quickly, how they're doing?

242
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,670
And it should tie you know, if they're doing badly to a way

243
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,910
you get them out of the company

244
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,330
or if they, they doing well it should there should be

245
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,870
a clear path to how this ties to compensation.

246
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,910
And that's the next thing.

247
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,620
In the early days of a Startup.

248
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,080
People's compensation is whatever they negotiate with the founder,

249
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
and it's all over the place.

250
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,690
As you grow.

251
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,190
It feels hopelessly corporate,

252
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,300
but it really is worth putting in place these compensation bands.

253
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
So a midlevel engineer is in this range.

254
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,820
A senior engineer's in this range.

255
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,950
Here's how you move from this to this.

256
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,220
And it keeps things really fair.

257
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,390
Someday everyone will find that everyone else is comp.

258
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,580
If it's all over the place it will be a complete meltdown disaster.

259
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,370
If you put these bands in place early.

260
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,590
It will at least be fair.

261
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,950
It will also save you a lot of crazy negotiation.

262
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,390
One thing that I think is really important

263
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,930
when it comes to HR is equity.

264
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,290
Most people get this right now for the early employees,

265
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,320
they give them a lot of equity.

266
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,410
But I think you should continue to give a lot of equity

267
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,130
all the way through.

268
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,600
And, this is one place that your investors

269
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,020
will always give you bad advice.

270
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,270
I think, not YC,

271
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,160
but all other investors give bad advice here, most do.

272
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,410
You should be giving out a lot of equity to your employees.

273
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,750
now, this dilutes everyone, right,

274
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,450
this dilutes you as the founder and the investors equally.

275
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,420
For some reason, founders usually understand this is good,

276
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,060
investors are very shortsighted and don't want to dilute themselves.

277
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,600
So they'll like fight you over every equity grant.

278
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,850
But we've seen a lot of data at YC now,

279
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,390
and the most successful companies,

280
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,480
and the ones where the investors do the best,

281
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,450
end up giving a lot of stock out to employees,

282
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,630
year after year after year.

283
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,970
So I tell founders like, you should think about,

284
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,750
you know, for the next ten years,

285
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,250
you're going to be giving out 3 to 5% of the company every year,

286
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,280
because you just get bigger and bigger.

287
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,610
So the individual grants get smaller, but in aggregate,

288
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,490
it's a lot of stock.

289
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,050
And I think this is really important to do,

290
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,300
if you value your people, you should be doing this.

291
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,180
specifically, you need to do this with refresher grants

292
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,550
and you should get a, a plan in place for this early.

293
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,670
You know, I think, you never want an employee in a place

294
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,220
where they vested three out of their four years of stock

295
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,320
and they start thinking about leaving.

296
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,710
So you should always stay in front of people's vesting schedules.

297
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,400
And you know, how they plan early

298
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
where you have refresher grants in place.

299
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,390
There are a lot of new structures that people have been using here.

300
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,430
I personally like six year, big grants,  but six years investing.

301
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,250
because I think these companies just take a while to build.

302
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,500
There's Pyramid Vesting where you back weight someone's grant,

303
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,000
so in year four they get a lot more of the vesting than year one.

304
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,950
There's a concept, different names for it,

305
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,750
but something like continuous forward vesting,

306
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,460
where people's grants are automatically reupped every year,

307
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,260
at the same number of shares.

308
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,370
Whatever you decide,

309
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,260
get an option management system in place at about this point.

310
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,340
The normal way people do this

311
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,040
is just someone keeps an Excel spreadsheet.

312
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,280
I have seen mistakes that have cost employees or companies

313
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,920
tens of millions of dollars because they didn't get this right.

314
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,720
So there's really good option management systems or software

315
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,740
and you should get those in place around this point.

316
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,310
The other sort of HR stuff to touch on,

317
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,150
there are a bunch of rules that change around 50 employees.

318
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,910
Common examples are that you have to start sexual harassment training

319
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,580
and diversity training there's a bunch of others as well.

320
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,550
But just put a little pin in your mind that

321
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,500
when you cross 50 employees there's a new set of HR rules

322
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,520
that you have to comply with.

323
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,010
Monitor your team for burnout.

324
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,840
Again, it's up to product market fit it's just to Sprint,

325
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,130
now it becomes a marathon.

326
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,680
At this point, you actually don't want people

327
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,210
to work a hundred hours a week forever.

328
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,490
You want them to go on vacation.

329
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,840
You want them to have new challenges and do new things.

330
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,210
And if you let the whole company get burned out all at once,

331
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,380
that, that is often a company-ending thing.

332
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
This is also a good time to put in place a, a hiring process.

333
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,380
Another thing that most founders regret is

334
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,590
they don't hire as soon as everything is working,

335
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,320
I think you should hire a full-time recruiter.

336
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,250
If you do this too early,

337
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,790
that's bad because you'll hire too fast, and that usually implodes.

338
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,770
But, most founders get behind the ball on this.

339
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,250
The other, there are a lot of other, sort of just hiring process tips.

340
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,800
For example, I think most companies,

341
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,690
even until they get up to say 3 or 400 employees

342
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,150
should announce every offer on some internal mailing list

343
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,630
or something before they make it,

344
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,110
because like half the time you do that,

345
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,600
someone in the company will know something good

346
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,750
or bad about that employee.

347
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,390
And the companies that I know that have instituted this

348
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,410
have been really happy.

349
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,420
Also a good time to have a program in place to ramp up employees,

350
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,150
so when someone starts, you know,

351
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,410
what does their first week look like?

352
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,490
How do they get, how do they get spun up?

353
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,920
How do they learn everything they need to learn?

354
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,620
Are they going to have a buddy that's going to think through them?

355
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,770
That's going to help them think through

356
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,910
kind of everything about the company.

357
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Here's one that you actually do need to think about

358
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,660
before the 12 to 24 month mark, which is diversity on the team ,.

359
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,670
The most common place this comes up honestly is people that hire,

360
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,830
you know, all guys on their engineering team

361
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,890
for the first 15 or 20 people.

362
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,390
And in that point you get a culture in place

363
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,920
that sort of takes on a life of it's own, and most founders

364
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,330
that I've spoken to that have made this mistake regret it

365
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,010
and they wished they had hired some diversity of perspective

366
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,170
on the team early on.

367
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,870
Engineering teams are not the only place where it comes up,

368
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,770
but that's where you see it the most often,

369
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,240
and if you get this right early

370
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,820
you'll be able to grow the team much more quickly

371
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,710
over, over the long-term.

372
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,620
The other thing to think about

373
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,010
is what happens to your early employees.

374
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,280
So, a common situation that happens is,

375
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,470
the company evolves fast the early employees you know, the company,

376
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,460
so like you hire an engineer who is a really great engineer,

377
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,080
but then as the engineering team grows you need a VP of Engineering.

378
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,580
The early engineer wants to be the VP of Engineering,

379
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,050
you can't do that, and but you don't the early employee to leave,

380
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,940
they're an important, important part of the culture,

381
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,030
they know a lot, people love them,

382
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,630
and so I think you want to be very proactive about this.

383
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,490
You know, you want to like think about

384
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,450
what's the path for my first 10 or 15 employees

385
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,880
going to be as the company grows,

386
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,900
and then just talk to them about it

387
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,600
very directly, be up front, you know.

388
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,760
I want, like sit them down and say,

389
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,370
I want to talk about, sort of where you want to see

390
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,320
your career go inside of this company.

391
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,480
All right, so company productivity,

392
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,650
this is something you don't need to think about in the early days

393
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,200
because small teams are just sort of naturally productive

394
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,630
most of the time.

395
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,970
But as you grow, it the productivity I think goes down

396
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,290
with the square of the number of employees

397
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,640
if you don't make an effort

398
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,260
because it sort of one of these like connections between nodes,

399
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,880
every pair of people adds communication overhead.

400
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,860
And so if you don't start thinking about the systems

401
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,810
that you're going to put in place,

402
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,170
when the company is 25 to 50 people,

403
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,610
to stay productive as you grow

404
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,460
things will grind to a halt faster than you can imagine.

405
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,580
The single word that matters most, I think,

406
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,780
to keep the company productive as it grows is alignment ,.

407
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,800
The reason companies become unproductive is

408
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,290
people are either not on the same page and you know,

409
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,290
don't know what the same priorities are,

410
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,190
or they're actively working against each other

411
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,270
which is obviously worse.

412
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,840
But if you can keep the entire company aligned in the same direction,

413
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:29,870
you'll have one well over half of the battle,

414
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,920
and, and the way to start with this

415
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,250
is just a very clear roadmap and goals.

416
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,850
Everyone in the company should know what the roadmap

417
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,250
for the next three or six months, or a year,

418
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,560
depending on where the company is in its life cycle, looks like.

419
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,350
You know, a classic test that I love to give

420
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,030
is if I walk into a company getting,

421
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,370
beginning to struggle with these scaling issues,

422
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,230
I'll ask the founders, like,

423
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,870
if I walked around and polled ten random employees

424
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,000
and asked them what the top three goals for the company are,

425
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,670
right now, would they all say the same thing?

426
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,480
And a 100% of the time, the founder says, yes, of course they would,

427
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,950
and I'd go do it, and 100% of the time,

428
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,570
no two employees even say the same three, top three goals, in order.

429
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,910
And founders can never believe it,

430
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,620
because they're like well I announced that in all hands

431
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,300
like three months ago what our goals were going to be,

432
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,190
and how can they not remember?

433
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,710
But it's really important to keep reiterating the,

434
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,690
the message about the roadmap and the goals,

435
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,980
and almost no founder does this enough.

436
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,290
And if you do it, you know the company will say, you know,

437
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,100
all right, these are our goals,

438
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,700
we understand them, we're going to get them done,

439
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,630
I know self-organize around that.

440
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,020
But if people don't know what the roadmap of their goals are

441
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,640
it won't happen.

442
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,050
We already talked about figuring out your values early,

443
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,490
but I want to reiterate that

444
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,500
because that also really help the company make the right decisions.

445
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,260
If everyone knows what the framework to decide is.

446
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,200
They'll make hopeful the same decisions if they're smart people.

447
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,830
You want to continue to be run by great products

448
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,520
and not process for its own sake, this is a fine, fine line.

449
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,180
Because you do need to put some process in place,

450
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,210
but you never want to put process in place that rewards the process.

451
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,670
The focus has to always be on great product.

452
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:17,030
One easy way to do this that a lot of companies try is they just say,

453
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,340
we're going to ship something every day,

454
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,550
and if you do that you know,

455
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,500
there's at least a continued focus on delivery.

456
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,380
And then transparency and rhythm in how you communicate

457
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,490
are really important, most founders wait way too long on these,

458
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,770
but having a management meeting every week,

459
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,870
of just the people that report directly to the founder

460
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,020
or the CEO, critical.

461
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,440
All hands meetings not quite sure how often is optimal for those,

462
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,710
at least once a month where you go through the results

463
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,370
and the real map with the entire company really important.

464
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,300
And then, you know, doing a plan every quarter of

465
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,800
what we're going to get down over the next three months

466
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,640
and how that fits into our goals for the year,

467
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,830
also becomes really important.

468
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,520
I put offsites up there,

469
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,310
because I don't think people do these nearly enough.

470
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,010
A surprising number of the successful companies

471
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,740
we've been involved with do a lot of offsites.

472
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,450
Where they'll take their best people for a weekend

473
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,590
to a cabin in the woods or somewhere and just talk about.

474
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,680
What do we want to be when we grow up?

475
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,550
What are our most important things to be doing?

476
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,130
What are we not doing that we should be doing?

477
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,690
But get people out of the office and out of the day-to-day,

478
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,990
everyone I know that does those thinks they're well worth the time.

479
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,100
So the goal in all of this productivity planning is that

480
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,110
you're trying to build a company that creates a lot of value

481
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,320
over a long period of time,

482
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,010
and the long period of time is what's important here.

483
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,290
You can avoid all of this

484
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,500
and just like with the authority of the founder

485
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,110
make sure the company ships a great next version.

486
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,390
But that won't work for version ten, it won't work for version 11.

487
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,820
I, I really believe that this single hardest thing in business

488
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,580
is building a company that does repeatable innovation

489
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,850
and just has this ongoing culture of excellence as it grows.

490
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,660
If you look at the examples of this most companies fail here.

491
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,810
Most companies do one great thing

492
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,680
where the founder just pushes to get it done

493
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,030
and then don't innovate that well on follow on products.

494
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,520
And it really takes founders that think about

495
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,830
how I'm going to do this second thing.

496
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,110
This really hard thing.

497
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,950
To get something like an Apple

498
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,850
that can churn out great products for 30 or 40 years, or longer.

499
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,370
All right, these are super tactical mechanics.

500
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:29,000
This is, this is definitely to just put on a list

501
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,380
and remember these things for later.

502
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,220
All right in the early days,

503
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,910
people basically ignore all accounting and they have,

504
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,740
like, maybe if they're lucky, a shoebox full of receipts.

505
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,100
They certainly don't have anything that looks like a financial report.

506
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,120
This is a good time to get it in place.

507
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,580
You know, when things are working, say, month 18 or whatever.

508
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,250
You can do this with an outsourced person.

509
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,100
Just say, you know what?

510
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,520
We want, like to get our books in order.

511
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,130
We want to start getting audits every year.

512
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,890
We want to start a relationship with an accounting firm.

513
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,360
Easy to do. Definitely worth it.

514
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,670
This is also a good time to collect your legal documents.

515
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,840
Because it's easy to fix things now.

516
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,790
So, if you actually assign someone to go through

517
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,170
and collect every agreement the company has ever signed.

518
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,190
Then when your landlord tries to **** you out of your lease

519
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,160
and no-one can find the lease which happens like,

520
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,540
half the time somehow someone will be able to find it.

521
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,840
Also, you're almost certainly missing something.

522
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,010
Some employee didn't sign their PIIA or whatever

523
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,270
and you'll find it now.

524
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,510
It's easy to fix now.

525
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,200
It gets really hard to fix, like,

526
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,150
in the middle of your next round of financing.

527
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,130
So, again, this is time to bring, like,

528
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,790
a little bit of the order to, to chaos.

529
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,890
FF stock is a special class of stock for founders

530
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,010
that the founders can sell in a later round,

531
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,090
without messing up the common-stock valuation.

532
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,880
It used to be that most people set this up

533
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,680
right when they started the company.

534
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,400
Founders fund sort of popularizes.

535
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,410
Which is why it's called FF stock.

536
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,650
But it became a really bad signal, right?

537
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,970
Founders that were obsessed with their own personal liquidity

538
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,710
when the company had nothing turned out to like fail most of the time.

539
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,520
And so investors learn that if founders pushed on this

540
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,110
in the seed round it was a very, very bad sign.

541
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,950
Most founders don't actually want to sell stock

542
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,490
until the company is worth, like

543
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,210
a billion dollars or something like that.

544
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,610
So, I think you can actually safely set this up

545
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,050
after things start working, in the next financial round,

546
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,200
and then you can sell it two, three, four years down the road.

547
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,390
But it's a good thing to remember

548
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,930
by about the time you get to the B round.

549
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:34,000
IP, trademarks and patents. actually, just IP and trademarks.

550
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,270
So, you have 12 months, after you announce something,

551
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,410
if you want to patent it.

552
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,280
And, if you miss that window, it's very hard to do.

553
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,620
so, 11 months after you launch,

554
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,630
or first publicly talk about what you're doing.

555
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,750
Is a good time to file provisional patents.

556
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,470
We recommend people just file provisional patents.

557
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,050
All that does is just hold your place in line at the patent office

558
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,900
and it gives you another year to decide

559
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,320
if you want to patent something or not.

560
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,450
It only costs about $1000.

561
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,580
It takes way less effort than a full patent.

562
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,710
And most of the time you'll know

563
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,520
whether or not you need full patent a year later.

564
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,150
But if you just do this one step,

565
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,080
you'll at least have the option.

566
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,440
It's also a good time to file trademarks for the U.S.

567
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,360
and major international markets.

568
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,100
again, if you don't do this at this stage,

569
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,050
most people end up regretting it.

570
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,460
And while you're at it, a good time to grab all the domains.

571
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,470
FP&A, good time also I think to think about

572
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,830
someone to start doing FP&A.

573
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,740
I think most companies don't end up realizing

574
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,950
where the knobs on their financial model are until far too late.

575
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,610
And I think it turns out that

576
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:45,110
if you have someone build a really great model of the business.

577
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,990
And by really great, apparently Roelof Botha,

578
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,420
who was the PayPal CFO and built their FP&A model.

579
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,320
The top, the, like,

580
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,420
the top sheet of his spreadsheet was 1,500 lines,

581
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,660
just as a level of the detail people build these to.

582
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,610
But you can really optimize the business

583
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:08,000
and understand it at a level that I think most people totally miss.

584
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,340
Most people don't hire someone like this

585
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,870
until they're many hundreds of employees.

586
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,060
I think it's worth hiring earlier.

587
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,550
Another thing that I think is worth hiring earlier

588
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,780
that almost no one does is a full time fundraiser.

589
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,400
Let's say you hire someone like really, really great

590
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,570
and their full time job is to raise money for the company.

591
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,190
You hire them after your b round.

592
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,440
And you say, you know what, by the time we raise our c round

593
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,020
we want the evaluation to be double what it would have been otherwise.

594
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,020
You almost certainly get better results

595
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,620
than if you hire an investive banker or someone else

596
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,210
if it's just someone internal to the company

597
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,230
and you end up paying way less money,

598
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,190
and take like literally half the dilution.

599
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,290
So, I think this is one of these like,

600
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,620
slightly none obvious optimizations

601
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,740
that people just failed to make.

602
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,320
Tax structuring, so, this is another thing.

603
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,330
most, once things are working.

604
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,780
It would be worth you spending a little bit of time

605
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,080
thinking about how you set up the tax structure for the company.

606
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,800
I confess, I don't know a lot about the details here

607
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,060
because I just find it personally really boring.

608
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,600
But like somehow if you assign all the IP to like some corporation

609
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,510
in Ireland that licenses it back to the U.S. corporation,

610
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,050
you end up paying like no tax, no corporate tax.

611
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,420
But I know you can only do that like relatively early on.

612
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,980
And this ends up being a huge issue for companies that don't do it

613
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,240
that compete with companies that do do it.

614
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,700
You know once they're big, public companies.

615
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,610
So that's worth doing.

616
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,410
A lot of people throughout the class have talked about

617
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,910
your own psychology as a founder.

618
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,630
Here's what they haven't said.

619
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,380
It gets worse, not better.

620
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,580
As the company grows, you continue to oscillate.

621
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,990
The highs are better but the lows keep getting worse.

622
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:53,670
And, you, you really want to think about this early on

623
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,570
and just be aware this is going to happen.

624
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,990
And try to try to manage your own psychology

625
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,740
through the expanding swings that it's going to go through.

626
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,080
Another thing that happens as you begin to be successful.

627
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,360
As you go from being someone that most people rooted for,

628
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,760
kind of the underdog, to someone that a lot of people start hating on.

629
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,470
And you know, you see this first in internet commenters who will be,

630
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,190
like, I can't believe this **** company raised money.

631
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,850
It **** sucks, like, awful.

632
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,050
And it only bothers you a little bit, but then, like,

633
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,330
journalists that you kind of care about start writing this,

634
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,310
and it just goes on and on.

635
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,830
This also will go on and on as you get more and more successful,

636
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,190
and you just have to make peace with this early.

637
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,760
But if you don't, it will bother you all the way through.

638
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,890
This is also a good time to start thinking about

639
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,000
how long of a journey this is going to be.

640
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,870
Very few founders think long term.

641
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,830
Most founders think kind of a year in advance.

642
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,810
And they think that you know what in three years

643
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,760
I'm going to sell my company

644
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,290
and either I'm going to become a VC

645
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,710
or sit on the beach or something.

646
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,130
Because so few people make an actual long term commitment

647
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,800
to what they're building, the ones that do have a huge advantage.

648
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,780
They're, they're in a very rarefied class,

649
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,910
and so this is a good time to like sit around with your cofounders

650
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,620
and decide, you know what,

651
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,430
we're going to work on this for a very long time.

652
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,750
And we're going to build a strategy that assumes

653
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,180
that we're going to be doing this for the next ten years.

654
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,630
Just thinking that way alone, I think is probably,

655
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,290
a very high leverage thing you can do for success.

656
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,150
Take vacation.

657
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,750
Another common thing that we see is founders will run their business

658
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,040
for three or four years, without ever taking,

659
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,650
you know, more than a day of vacation.

660
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,530
And that works for like a year, or two years, or something like that.

661
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,410
It really leads to nasty burnout if you don't do it.

662
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,090
Losing focus is another way that founders get off track.

663
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,690
I actually think this is a symptom of burnout.

664
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,880
When you get really burned out on running the business,

665
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,170
you want to do easier things,

666
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,380
or sort of more gratifying things.

667
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,580
You want to go to conferences,

668
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,370
and have people tell you how great you are.

669
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,600
You know, you want to do all these things

670
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,450
that are not actually building the business.

671
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,060
And the most common post-YC failure case for the companies we fund

672
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,760
is that they're incredibly focused,

673
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,400
during YC, on their company,

674
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,650
and then after, they start doing a lot of other things.

675
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,520
You know, they, they advise companies.

676
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,040
They go to conferences, whatever.

677
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,010
Focus is what made you successful in the first place.

678
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,220
There are a lot of reasons people lose focus,

679
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,880
but fight against that really, really hard.

680
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,690
This is a special case of focus.

681
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,880
As you start to do well.

682
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,470
You will start to get a bunch of potential acquires sniffing around.

683
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,440
And it's very gratifying.

684
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,870
And you're like wow, I can be so rich and that'd be so cool.

685
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,240
And negotiations feel really fun.

686
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,260
This is one the biggest killers of, of companies is

687
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,490
that they entertain acquisition conversations.

688
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,450
You, you distract yourself.

689
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,650
You get demoralized if it doesn't happen.

690
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,070
If an offer does come in and it's really low,

691
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,060
you've already like mentally thought that you're done,

692
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,190
and so you take the offer.

693
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,420
As a general rule, don't start any acquisition conversation

694
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,000
unless you're willing to sell for a pretty low number.

695
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,680
Don't ever just check it hoping that

696
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,030
you're going to have the one miracle high offer.

697
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,510
If that's going to happen you'll know.

698
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,720
Because they'll just make you a big offer before you can meet them.

699
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,220
But this, this is a big company killer.

700
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,160
And then just as a reminder to everybody the thing

701
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,210
that kills startups at some level is the founders giving up.

702
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,390
So sometimes you should quit.

703
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,050
But, if you mismanage your own psychology and you quit when,

704
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:49,570
when you shouldn't, that, that is what kills companies.

705
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,800
I mean that is, that is the sort of final closet death

706
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,950
in most of these start ups.

707
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,380
And so if you can manage your own psychology

708
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,750
in a way that you don't quit.

709
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,470
Don't go to place a where you need to quit,

710
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,190
or give up on the startup.

711
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,760
You'll be in a far, far better place.

712
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,470
So, marketing and PR is something that

713
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,870
we tell companies to ignore for a long time.

714
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,520
Everyone thinks in the early days

715
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,500
that the press is going to be what saves them.

716
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,750
We tell them all the time it doesn't work that way.

717
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,850
It's definitely true.

718
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,510
You know, press is not what's going to save your startup.

719
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,570
But as you start to be successful,

720
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,280
this is something that the founders themselves need to spend time on.

721
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,720
So, once your product is working,

722
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,690
switch from not caring about this, to caring about it a little bit.

723
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,630
And, the two most important things for the founder to do,

724
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,770
the founders to do.

725
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,920
Figure out the key messaging yourselves.

726
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,190
Never outsource this to your head of marketing or PR firm.

727
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,660
You, founders have to figure out

728
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,730
what the message of the company is going to be.

729
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,000
And once you set that, it kind of sticks.

730
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,740
It's very hard to change this once the press decides

731
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,760
how they're going to talk about you.

732
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,810
The other thing is getting to know key journalists yourself.

733
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,330
PR firms will always try to prevent you from doing this,

734
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,440
because they need to have a reason to exist.

735
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,560
And so they're like,

736
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,210
well, we're going to handle the relationship with the journalist.

737
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,620
We'll just bring you in for interviews.

738
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,270
No journalist wants to talk to a PR flack, ever.

739
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,800
They're so much more happy to just hear from a founder.

740
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,640
I think the biggest PR hack you can do, is to not hire a PR firm.

741
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,120
Just pick three or four journalists

742
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,100
that you develop really close relationships with,

743
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,860
that like you, that understand you, that you get.

744
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,860
And then you contact them yourself.

745
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,070
They will cover every story you ever give them,

746
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,990
and they'll actually pay attention,

747
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,040
get to know you and care about the company.

748
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,500
This is so much better than the normal strategy of

749
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,000
having a PR firm blast 200 contacts that never read their e-mails,

750
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,170
with every piece of news.

751
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,060
so, this is something that I think is important to start doing.

752
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,760
This is also the time in a company

753
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,730
when business development starts to matter.

754
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,270
And so, in the early days you can basically ignore

755
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,420
anything that would be like doing deals,

756
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,390
except maybe fund raising and sales.

757
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,610
You know, this is the time when they're important.

758
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,510
And everything, or many things that you do,

759
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,040
like even fundraising, falls under the, the category of doing deals.

760
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,600
So there are, here's my one-minute crash course on this.

761
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,460
There are five points that I think are important to understand here.

762
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,540
We've talked about this a lot.

763
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,510
Nothing will serve,

764
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,490
nothing will matter if you don't build a great product.

765
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,380
So assume that you've done this before you go try

766
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,160
and get anyone to do anything with you.

767
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,680
Developing a personal connection with anyone

768
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,810
you're trying to do any sort of big deal with, is really important.

769
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,730
For whatever reason, most founders fail to do this,

770
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,150
or many founders fail to do this.

771
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,700
But no one wants to feel like they're this transactional thing,

772
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,950
that you're using them to get distribution for your product,

773
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,140
or to raise money, or whatever.

774
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,330
And, so figuring out some way to actually care about this person

775
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,040
and care about what you're doing with them.

776
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,830
And not view them, you have to in your own mind

777
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,730
not just view them as a one off transaction.

778
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,030
You have to actually care about them

779
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,460
and what they're going to get out of this.

780
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,000
Competitive dynamics,

781
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,350
so this is like basic principle of negotiation.

782
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,550
Most funders learn this the first time in fundraising

783
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,830
but it actually matters for everything.

784
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,210
The way you get deals done, and the way you get good terms,

785
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,140
is to have a competitive situation.

786
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,230
You know, if you don't do this deal with party A,

787
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,400
you're going to do it with party B.

788
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,150
It's not always an option, but it usually is, and this is,

789
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,500
like, the single thing that makes deals happen and makes deals move.

790
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,250
Tyler talked about persistence the last lecture

791
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,230
so I won't hit on that again too much, other than to say,

792
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,350
you have to go beyond your comfort point here,

793
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,950
most of the time as a founder.

794
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,440
And then, the fifth point is you have to ask for what you want.

795
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,530
This is another thing, I still have trouble with this,

796
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,740
and certainly most of the founders we do.

797
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,540
Have, you know, if you want something to deal, just ask for it.

798
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,830
Most of the time, you know,

799
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,570
you won't get laughed out of the room and you might get it.

800
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,430
But you have to be like, at some point you actually have to say,

801
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,020
you know this is what I'd like you to do.

802
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,610
Even if it feels aggressive or an overreach, or whatever.

803
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,120
So I'm going to close, this part of the talk with an image.

804
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,360
One of the Airbnb founders drew this on like a business card

805
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,960
or something for another founder that was starting a company.

806
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,600
And then I saw it once and took a picture of it.

807
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,450
Because I thought it was such a good summary.

808
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:21,730
And what he had tried to draw here

809
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,610
was the Ycombinator process as he remembered it.

810
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,350
And I love it because it's like so simple,

811
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,510
and it looks so do-able when it's written on a business card.

812
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,850
But you're trying to find product market fit.

813
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,600
You know, you're trying to build a product,

814
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,060
and you're trying to close the gap between those two gears.

815
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,070
The only way to do that is to go off and meet the people.

816
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,930
You cannot do this without getting really, really close to your users.

817
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,300
And then he drew this graph that,

818
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,930
sort of on a whiteboard at YC and gotten kind of,

819
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,970
like, one of the YC rites of passage,

820
00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:00,150
but that's the graph of how adoption goes for a new company.

821
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,040
So you launch in the press, you get a huge spike.

822
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,220
It falls off to nothing.

823
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,470
At some point, at least one point,

824
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,270
things look like they're going to completely die

825
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,120
and kind of dip below the x-axis.

826
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,550
They recover a little bit.

827
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,110
You have this long, long, long trough of sorrow before things work.

828
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,270
In Airbnb's case,

829
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,430
it was 1,000 days before the graph started ticking upward.

830
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,280
You have these wiggles of false hope,

831
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,210
and then finally, finally, finally, things start to grow.

832
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,140
Three years later.

833
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,430
So starting a startup ends up being this very long process.

834
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,470
It is, you know, it can be really rewarding.

835
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,220
It's definitely long, but it is do-able.

836
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,130
And that's what I love about that drawing.

837
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,380
So, with that, I think I have about ten minutes left.

838
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,660
I can answer questions on this,

839
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,320
or anything else in the course that we've covered.

840
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,580
If anyone has some.

841
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,430
Yes.

842
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,610
>> You have that diversity being important,

843
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:53,270
but an earlier speaker said diversity wasn't important

844
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,720
and you should just hire people that are very much like you,

845
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,250
and then you can cross.

846
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,420
>> So, here is the the question is,

847
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,140
how do you you square the device of diversity being important

848
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:06,030
with earlier speakers saying you want people that are very similar.

849
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:12,800
the, the difference what you want is you want diversity of backgrounds

850
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,130
but you don't want diversity of vision.

851
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,240
Like where companies get in trouble is

852
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,270
when they have people think very differently about

853
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,400
what the company should be doing, or don't work well together.

854
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,300
You don't want that.

855
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,180
You do want to hire people that you know,

856
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,710
and that you trust and that you can work with.

857
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,000
But if everyone on the team comes from exactly the same background

858
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,740
you end, you do end up developing somewhat of a mono-culture

859
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,750
which often causes problems down the road.

860
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,290
Not always. Some companies have been successful with that.

861
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,680
So what, what we tell people is, hire people that you know

862
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,960
and that you've worked with before.

863
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,100
But try to hi, try to hire people that are complementary

864
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,160
and align towards the same goal,

865
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,470
not people that are exactly the same.

866
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,330
because you just get a, a better skill set.

867
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,010
Yeah.

868
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,260
>> So what are some examples of ways

869
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,830
to make up productivity on a personal level?

870
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,470
How do you do that on a personal level and also on an advance level?

871
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,670
>> >> How to keep track, productivity systems.

872
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,760
So, the one I use, which actually I think works really

873
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,760
well, is I keep one piece of paper with my goals

874
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,090
for sort of a three to 12 month time frame.

875
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,710
And I look at that every day.

876
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,490
And then separately I keep one,

877
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,680
one page for every day of my short term goals for that day.

878
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,300
And so if I need to do something in like a week,

879
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,350
I just flip forward seven pages and write it down,

880
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,830
and then I also keep a list of every person

881
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,470
and what they're working on, and what I need to tell them,

882
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,450
and what I need to talk to them about,

883
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,790
what we talked about last time.

884
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,010
So every time I sit down with someone,

885
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,190
I kind of have the full statement,

886
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,860
a list of things for that person that works really well.

887
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,000
Yes.

888
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,920
>> So we talked about that startup growing.

889
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,310
But most startups fail.

890
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:55,600
>> Yeah.

891
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,160
>> Any advice for kind of fail gracefully.

892
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,580
>> Yeah. Great question.

893
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,740
>> >> How to fail gracefully.

894
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:09,970
So, most startups fail,and Silicon Valley almost goes too far

895
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,790
in how much it loves failure.

896
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,250
Failure still sucks. You should still try not to fail.

897
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,640
And this whole, like, thing, of like, failure's great,

898
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,750
I, I don't agree with.

899
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,130
But it will happen to most people most of the time,

900
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,830
and it's a very forgiving environment.

901
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,540
As long as you are upfront about it, and ethical,

902
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,640
and don't let anyone get into a bad situation.

903
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,400
So, if you're failing, first of all, you should tell your investors.

904
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,050
And, second of all, you should not totally run out of money.

905
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,710
What you don't want is a blow-up with a bunch of, you know,

906
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,700
debts that the company owe, and everyone, you know,

907
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,950
showing up to work, one day, and the door being locked.

908
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,790
You'll know when you're failing, you'll know when the company is,

909
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,450
things just aren't going to work,

910
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,310
and you should just tell your investors.

911
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,030
Like, hey, sorry, this isn't going to work.

912
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,210
No one will be surprised.

913
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,130
Like, I expect to lose my, or I'm willing to lose my money

914
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,550
on every investment I ever make.

915
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,440
I know that happens most of the time, and the winners pay for it,

916
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,240
you know, still with a factor of 100, so it's okay.

917
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,660
No one, people will be very understanding and supportive.

918
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,330
But you want to tell people early.

919
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,510
You don't want to surprise them.

920
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,590
And you want, you don't want to like

921
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:17,950
let your employees gets shocked when they learn they don't have a job.

922
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:18,420
you know, you, you,

923
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,260
you want to shut the company down in a graceful way.

924
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,280
Help them find jobs.

925
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,920
Make sure you give them two or four weeks of severance payment,

926
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,660
so that they're not suffering a cash flow problem.

927
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,510
All that stuff is pretty important.

928
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,010
Yes.

929
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,450
>> How many immigrant founders have you seen in Y Combinator?

930
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,000
>> How many immigrant founders have we seen in Y Combinator?

931
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,730
In the last batch, I think it probably went up for this next batch,

932
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,340
in the last batch 41% of the founders

933
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,850
we funded were born outside the US.

934
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,950
From 30 different countries.

935
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,930
So it's. Yeah a pretty big percentage.

936
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:54,120
>> What do you think are other good places to start a start up?

937
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,020
>> Apart from the Valley

938
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,960
where do I think are other good places to start a start up?

939
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,520
Well I still think the Valley is the best by a very significant margin

940
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,370
But I think it's finally, maybe beginning to weaken a little bit.

941
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,260
Because the costs have just gotten so out of control.

942
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
To be clear, if I was going to start a company

943
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,720
I still wouldn't think about.

944
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,340
I would still pick Silicon Valley.

945
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,330
And I think if you look at the data of companies

946
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,000
over the last few years, Valley still wins by a lot.

947
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,690
But Seattle, LA, lots of places outside the U.S.,

948
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,610
I think all of these make sense.

949
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,710
>> Like what places outside?

950
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,330
I hesitate to make recommendations there

951
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,790
because I haven't spent enough time in this cities

952
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,850
to really have an intuitive feel.

953
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,000
but, like, I mean, you, you know as well as

954
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,200
I do the common ones people talk about, startup hubs,

955
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,150
and I just, I can't make a personal recommendation there.

956
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,440
>> Hire a professional CEO or like a senior.

957
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,670
>> When should the founders think about hiring a professional CEO?

958
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:57,220
Never. you, if you look at the most successful.

959
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,110
Companies in tech, they are run by their founders

960
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:04,480
for a very long time, sometimes forever.

961
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,750
And sometimes they even hire a professional CEO

962
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,000
and then realize that that is not going to like build a great company.

963
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,410
And so, like Larry Page came back to CEO again.

964
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,110
I think, if you don't want to be the long-term CEO of a company,

965
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,840
you probably shouldn't start one.

966
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,450
I'm not totally sure about that. I think there are exceptions.

967
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,590
But generally, that, the transition I talked about today,

968
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,300
if you go from building a great product

969
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,280
to building a great company.

970
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,390
Being a founder, you know, for nine of the ten years

971
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,000
is going to be about building that great company.

972
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,220
And if you're, if you're not excited about doing that

973
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,310
I think you should think hard about, about it.

974
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,550
Yes?

975
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,240
>> What are some of the most common

976
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,300
and most alarming warning signs you should be looking for.

977
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,370
When you're trying to make this shift from building great products

978
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,620
to building great companies.

979
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,270
What are the, the most common mistakes to make

980
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,530
when you're shifting towards building your own company?

981
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,910
I think I went through most of them here.

982
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,110
I tried to put everything in here

983
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,640
that I see people mess up most of the time.

984
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:06,970
Yes?

985
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,190
>> Is there a way to get involved in the Y com,

986
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,110
community before getting accepted?

987
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,350
Is there a way to get involved with YC before getting funded?

988
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,510
No, and intentionally not.

989
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,420
Actually I'll say the one thing you can do

990
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,960
is if you work at a YC company.

991
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:29,330
And then later apply I think that probably like, well not probably.

992
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,200
That definitely if you get a good recommendation

993
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,240
from those founders will help with YC.

994
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:38,770
So you know, working at a YC company helps.

995
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,790
But there's not much you can do to help and that's intentional.

996
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:46,090
Like there is no pre start up in a way that there's pre-med.

997
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,000
You should just focus on whatever you're doing.

998
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,430
And when you start a start up, there's things like YC and others

999
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,870
that are structured to help you.

1000
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,140
Most of the founders we fund, we don't know at all before we do it.

1001
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:56,790
You know, you don't,

1002
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,670
you really don't need to get to know us or get involved.

1003
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,410
We're, we're all good that way. Yes?

1004
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,220
>> There's a statistic of saying,

1005
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,420
now harder to get into Y company then getting, getting into Harvard.

1006
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,640
So I'm curious, the criteria that are used, think of start-up,

1007
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,710
does it change over time, or?

1008
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,610
>> The question is what,

1009
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,620
what criteria do we use to pick start-ups and has it gotten harder?

1010
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,700
Has it changed?

1011
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,760
You know, we, the two things that we need to see are,

1012
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,190
are good founders and a good idea.

1013
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:32,000
And without both of those, we, we won't fund a company.

1014
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,210
But that hasn't changed.

1015
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,730
That has, that has always been the case.

1016
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,230
The applicant pool to YC has grown quite a bit.

1017
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:43,160
But most of, or a lot of the growth is, you know,

1018
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,930
people that shouldn't be starting start-ups anyway.

1019
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,080
Probably, that are just doing it

1020
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,370
because it's sort of the cool thing now.

1021
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,010
So you know, if you're really passionate about an idea.

1022
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:51,980
And the idea is good.

1023
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,900
And you're you know,

1024
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,480
smart and get things done that you're executing.

1025
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,650
I still think you have a, a very reasonable shot at YC,

1026
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,710
even though the headline number is bigger.

1027
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:00,530
Yes.

1028
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:04,340
>> The certain, certain market that you're really excited about

1029
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,320
but don't necessarily know a lot about yet.

1030
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,740
Is there a certain or ways to --

1031
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,890
>> Sure. If there's a market that you're excited about

1032
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,360
but don't know a lot about yet, what should you do?

1033
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:20,060
Two schools of thought on this. One is to just jump right in.

1034
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,450
Learn it as you go. That's worked a lot of times.

1035
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,000
The other is to go work at a company in the space

1036
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,160
or do something in, in the market for,

1037
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,340
you know, a year or two years.

1038
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,030
I lean slightly towards the second.

1039
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:37,060
But as long as you're willing to really learn and really study

1040
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,940
and really get uncomfortably close to your users,

1041
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,840
either case will work.

1042
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,230
And I don't think it's that much of a disadvantage.

1043
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,720
I, I think, all things being equal,

1044
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,280
I would go spend a couple years learning about it in detail,

1045
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,170
but I don't think you have to.

1046
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,470
Yes?

1047
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,070
>> I have question related to YC to.

1048
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:57,770
>> Sure.

1049
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:58,610
>> Yeah so,

1050
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:02,230
I think that YC does fantastic job in promoting partnership,

1051
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,430
in Silicon Valley.

1052
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,470
In fact, as an institutional investor

1053
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,840
I actually I invested a suite up at YC.

1054
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,060
In the past a few years, the hardware has things like you know,

1055
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,730
you guys has 180 companies every year jumping into the market.

1056
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:18,990
And it looks like it's hard to follow

1057
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,350
each of the YC companies any more.

1058
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:23,170
Do you think that this will create some you know,

1059
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,280
if some people will walk away from YC.

1060
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,680
Because they cannot follow such a large batch of companies.

1061
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,420
The company has to be very polished

1062
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,510
and the founder has to be thinking over and over about ideas.

1063
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,520
Easy to access the capital-

1064
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,870
>> All right, so I think the question is do I think

1065
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,140
investors are going to fund less YC companies as we grow?

1066
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,640
no. Definitely not.

1067
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,310
Like certainly the trend in this is the other way.

1068
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:53,430
We have more and more investors saying that, you know,

1069
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,530
half their portfolio's now YC companies.

1070
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:59,020
And they're looking forward to the day where it's three-quarters.

1071
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,450
No I don't think that's a problem at all.

1072
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,470
I think that is like so not on my top 100 problem list.

1073
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,210
The opposite of that maybe.

1074
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,790
All right, one more question.

1075
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,310
Yes.

1076
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:11,550
>> When should a group of founders raise a seed fund or the first fund

1077
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,060
>> When should a group of founders raise some seed money?

1078
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:14,910
This is a great question.

1079
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:21,280
I think that, I think that in general.

1080
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,190
It's nice to wait until you have the idea figured out

1081
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,510
and initial signs of promise before you raise money.

1082
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,380
Raising money puts some pressure on the company.

1083
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,950
Some time pressure.

1084
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,960
And once you've raised money

1085
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,390
you can't be in this exploratory phase indefinitely.

1086
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,350
you, and you end up having to rush.

1087
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,040
And so, like, if you haven't raised money,

1088
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,130
and your idea's not working, you can, you know,

1089
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,000
like flail around and pivot

1090
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,550
until you really hit on the thing that's working.

1091
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,390
But if you raise money and your idea doesn't work,

1092
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,050
you're in this like oh **** moment, and you have to pivot.

1093
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,260
And you pivot to whatever the first vaguely plausible idea is.

1094
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,780
And that's bad. So I think.

1095
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,890
If you can wait to raise any outside capital more than say,

1096
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,300
like $100 or $200,000 if you're necessary, but ideally not even that.

1097
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,720
Until things are working,

1098
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,190
or at least pointing in the direction of working

1099
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,190
you're way better off.

1100
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,130
All right, thank you all very much, this was fun.
